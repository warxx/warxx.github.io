                            There’s been a fair bit of hype surrounding the latest SpaceX upright rocket landing. Simple as it seems, the excitementSci-Fi Today,
                            Reality TV Tomorrow, at least for me, stems from how the feat has brought us one step closer to fulfilling our sci-fi fantasies – etched
                            into our minds by the many blockbuster flicks Hollywood has produced. If you can recall one of the opening scenes of The Martian, we
                            witnessed the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) lifting off, attempting to escape an ensuing dust storm. While most of the focus was on the
                            misfortune of Mark Watney – played by Matt Damon, left behind after being struck by debris, you could say we took for granted how easily
                            the MAV ascended into space. Combine the thought of how the MAV got there in the first place, and you have yourself a similar parallel
                            to the SpaceX launch and landing. So what am I getting at? Science fiction only remains science fiction until technology catches up
                            with our imagination. This applies not just to space travel, but every other area of technological advancement.
